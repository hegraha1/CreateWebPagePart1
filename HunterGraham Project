<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Hunter Earl Graham and I am 17 years old from Morgantown WV. I like sports, video games, and my passion is marine biology. I am a competitive Valorant player who is in the top 5,000 players in North America. I was born on October 3rd, 2003 in Hampton Roads, VA. I grew up as an only child with a single mom and my grandparents who live right across the street. My grandpa has been my father figure since day one and I couldn’t ask for a better one</p>

He worked on the SR-71 Blackbird’s engines and got to see the plane again a few years ago at the Smithsonian Museum of Air and Space. He loves golf, cooking shows, and spending time with my grandma, mom, and myself</p>
